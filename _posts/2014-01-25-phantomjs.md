##Install

If you want to make use of PhantomJS headless testing, you'll additionally need to [install PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) and make sure it's in your `PATH`.

###Installing PhantomJS on Windows

1. Download `phantomjs-x.y.z-windows.zip` and extract it.
2. Move the contents of `phantomjs-x.y.z-windows` to `C:\bin\phantomjs`
3. Add `C:\bin\phantomjs` to `PATH`
4. Check that it works by issuing `phantomjs --version` in cmd
